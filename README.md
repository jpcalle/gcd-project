# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project

This repo contains the files needed to tidy the dataset of [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The file *run_analisys.R* performs all the tidy tasks on the original datasets. Given that the datasets are placed in a folder named *uci_har_dataset* in the same directory in which is the run_analisys.R script.

The run_analisys.R script returns a new dataset named *uci_har_dataset.txt* in the same folder of the script.
