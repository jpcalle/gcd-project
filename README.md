# Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project

This repo contains the files needed to tidy the dataset of [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) dataset.

The script run_analysis.R performs all the tidy tasks on the original datasets, given that the datasets are placed in a folder named uci_har_dataset located in the same folder of the script.

The run_analysis.R script returns a new dataset named uci_har_dataset.txt in the same folder of the script.

This should be the working directory structure:
